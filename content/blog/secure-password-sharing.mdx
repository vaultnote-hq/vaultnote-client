# How to Securely Share Passwords with Your Team

Every day, millions of passwords are shared through insecure channels like email, Slack, or text messages. This creates significant security vulnerabilities that can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access.

## The Problem with Traditional Password Sharing

When you send a password via email or chat, it typically:

- **Remains in the recipient's inbox indefinitely** - creating a permanent record
- **Gets backed up to multiple servers** - increasing exposure points
- **Can be accessed if the account is compromised** - one breach exposes all shared credentials
- **May be visible to IT administrators** - reducing true confidentiality

## Why This Matters

According to recent security reports, over 80% of data breaches involve compromised credentials. Many of these breaches could have been prevented with proper password sharing practices.

## Best Practices for Secure Password Sharing

### 1. Use Self-Destructing Notes

Services like VaultNote allow you to create encrypted notes that automatically delete after being read. This ensures the password doesn't persist in any system.

**How it works:**
1. Create a note with the password
2. Set it to delete after reading
3. Share the link with your colleague
4. Once they view it, it's gone forever

### 2. Enable Password Protection

Add an additional layer of security by requiring a password to access the shared credential. Share this password through a different channel (e.g., phone call or in-person).

### 3. Set Expiration Times

Configure notes to expire after a specific time period, even if they haven't been read. This limits the window of vulnerability.

### 4. Use End-to-End Encryption

Ensure the service you use encrypts data on your device before transmission. With zero-knowledge encryption, even the service provider cannot read your passwords.

## What About Password Managers?

Password managers are excellent for personal use and team credential management. However, they're not always practical for:

- Sharing with external contractors
- One-time credential sharing
- Situations where you don't want to add someone to your team vault

In these cases, self-destructing encrypted notes are the perfect solution.

## Conclusion

Secure password sharing is essential for maintaining your organization's security posture. By using encrypted, self-destructing notes, you can share credentials safely without leaving a trail of sensitive data across multiple systems.
