# GDPR-Compliant Communication: A Complete Guide

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has fundamentally changed how businesses handle personal data. If you're sharing sensitive information, understanding compliance isn't optional—it's essential.

## What GDPR Means for Data Sharing

GDPR applies to any organization that processes personal data of EU residents, regardless of where the organization is based. Key principles include:

- **Data minimization** - Only collect and share what's necessary
- **Purpose limitation** - Use data only for specified purposes
- **Storage limitation** - Don't keep data longer than needed
- **Security** - Implement appropriate technical measures

## Common Compliance Pitfalls

### 1. Email Attachments

Sending sensitive documents via email creates multiple compliance issues:

- Data persists in email servers indefinitely
- No control over forwarding or copying
- Difficult to prove deletion

### 2. Cloud Storage Links

Sharing via Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.:

- Links can be forwarded without your knowledge
- Data may be stored in non-compliant regions
- Revocation doesn't guarantee deletion from caches

### 3. Messaging Apps

WhatsApp, Slack, Teams:

- Messages are often backed up automatically
- Company policies may retain all communications
- Screenshots can't be prevented

## How Self-Destructing Notes Help

VaultNote addresses these compliance challenges:

### Automatic Deletion

Notes can be configured to:

- Delete after being read once
- Expire after a set time period
- Both (whichever comes first)

This supports the **storage limitation** principle automatically.

### Swiss Hosting

All data is stored in Switzerland, which has:

- Adequacy decision from the EU
- Strong domestic privacy laws
- No mass surveillance programs

### Zero-Knowledge Architecture

Since we can't read your data:

- No risk of unauthorized internal access
- Simplified compliance auditing
- Reduced liability

## Best Practices for GDPR-Compliant Sharing

### 1. Assess Necessity

Before sharing any personal data, ask:

- Is this data necessary for the purpose?
- Can I achieve the same goal with less data?
- Have I documented the lawful basis?

### 2. Choose Appropriate Channels

For sensitive personal data:

- Use encrypted, self-destructing notes
- Set appropriate expiration times
- Enable password protection for extra security

### 3. Document Everything

Maintain records of:

- What data was shared
- With whom
- For what purpose
- When it was deleted

### 4. Inform Data Subjects

If sharing personal data about third parties:

- Ensure you have appropriate consent or legal basis
- Inform them about the sharing when required
